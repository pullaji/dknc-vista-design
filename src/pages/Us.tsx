            Founded on the principle that great architecture emerges from understanding context,

                <p>
                  At DKnC, we believe architecture should respond to its environment 
                  while transcending time. Our designs emerge from a deep understanding 
                  of place, purpose, and the people who inhabit our spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a commitment to sustainability and innovation, we create 
                  structures that honor their context while pushing boundaries. Each 
                  project represents a unique collaboration between our vision and our 
                  clients' aspirations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our approach is rooted in narrative â€“ every space tells a story, 
                  every detail serves a purpose, and every project contributes to a 
                  legacy of thoughtful, enduring design.
